## $NFLY Paid once - subscribe forever 

    The utility of an investment for entertainment. Use $NFLY div
    & paid for Netflix subscription. 

    This strategy can be applied to any subscriptions. The 
    downside is that the net asset value might erode over time.

## Roth IRA Strategy

Roth IRA has a contribution limit & cash can be generated with Dividend and options. The $ generated from one asset type will be used to buy shares on the other asset type.

**Equity: $HOOD + $RKLB**
> The bear case is that Robinhood takes out the "buy" button & Rocker lab don't launch any more rockets
> Use premium from Cover calls & Cash Secure puts to buy YieldMax ETF

**YieldMax ETF: $MSTY + $NYDY + $TSLY**
> New contribution will be going toward YieldMax ETF
> Nav might erode 
> Dividend will be used to buy $HOOD & $RKLB
